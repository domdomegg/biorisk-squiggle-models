# Quantitive models of AI-driven bioterrorism and lab leak biorisk

This repository contains supplementary code for the paper _Quantitive models of AI-driven bioterrorism and lab leak biorisk_.

It contains the code for two models:
- [bioterrorism-uplift.squiggle](./bioterrorism-uplift.squiggle)
- [lab-leaks-uplift.squiggle](./lab-leaks-uplift.squiggle)

Each model aims to give a quantitive estimate for the number of pandemics per year from the different sources, before and after the impact of transformative AI.

Further details about the models are given in the paper, and via inline comments in the code.

## Running the models

One of the easiest ways to run the models is to copy and paste the model code into the [Squiggle Playground](https://www.squiggle-language.com/playground). Then set the output type dropdown in the right hand side panel from 'Variables' to 'Result'.

You can then adjust the assumptions in the calculator, and see the 5th, 50th and 95th percentile estimates for number of pandemics per year under the resulting graph.
