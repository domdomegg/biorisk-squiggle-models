# Quantitative models of AI-driven bioterrorism and lab leak biorisk

This repository contains supplementary code for the paper _Quantitative models of AI-driven bioterrorism and lab leak biorisk_.

The main model code is in [model.squiggle](./model.squiggle). It aims to give a quantitative estimate for the number of pandemics per year from the different biorisk sources, before and after the impact of transformative AI.

Further details about the models are given in the paper.

## Running the models

One of the easiest ways to run the models is to copy and paste the model code into the [Squiggle Playground](https://www.squiggle-language.com/playground). Then set the output type dropdown in the right hand side panel to 'Variables'.

You can adjust the assumptions in the code, and see the 5th, 50th and 95th percentile estimates for number of pandemics per year under the resulting graph.
